# File Name Description Language - ver0.1_draft

## Definition

FNDL defines the naming conventions assigned to folders and files.
It describes the structure and composition that file and folder names should have.
This specification is stored in YAML format.

## Detailed specifications

Must include at least 3 parts without omission and in order, using "---".

```yaml

---

### part1: Tree structure of folders and patterns that names should have

- folder_name: # Ending with ":" indicates it's a folder
  - subfolder_name:   #Tree structure is expressed by spaces at the front
  - <pattern1>-<color>  #Patterns are expressed using < and >
---

### part2: Actual examples that can be used for patterns defined in part1. Not mandatory

color:["black","red","white"]  # Stored as an array
---

### part3: Describes patterns defined in part1 that can be expressed as regular expressions

pattern1:'.+'  
```
Custom pattern names must use lowercase. Uppercase patterns may be included in the specification (such as YYYY, MM, etc.)

#### Real examples

```yaml

---

- Reports:
    - <YYYY>: # Year 2020 2021 2022 ...
        - <MM>: # Month 01 02 03 ...
            - <YYYYMMDD>-<TITLE>.xlsx # 20200101-Marketing Report.xlsx
- <INDEX01>-<routine_work>: # 02-Customer Management 03-Monitoring ...
- projects:
    - <project>: # Project Name
        - <task>:
            - <TITLE>-<task>-<project>-<YYYYMMDD>-v<ver>.<EXT> # Moon Landing Project Proposal-Planning-Moon Landing-20200101-v1.0.ppt

---

# The second area: lists examples of patterns that can be used.

task: ["Research", "Planning", "Development", "Release", "Marketing"]
project: ["MoonLanding", "MoonShot", "MoonWalking"]
EXT: ["pdf", "xlsx", "ppt"]

---

# In the third area: patterns that can be recognized by computers are described using regular expressions.

YYYYMMDD: '(?:19|20)\d{2}(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])(?:0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])' # Date (Year-Month-Day)
YYYY: '(?:19|20)\d{2}' # Year 2019 2020 2021 ...
MM: "0[1-9]|1[0-2]" # Month 01 02 .. 12
INDEX01: "0[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]" # Number 01 02 03 ...
INDEX001: "0[0-9]{2}|[1-9][0-9]{2}" # Number 001 002 003 ...
ver: '(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-([0-9A-Za-z-]+(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*))?(?:\+([0-9A-Za-z-]+(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*))?' # Version 1.0.0 Reference: https://github.com/nils-tekampe/semverdoc/blob/master/semverdoc.md
EXT: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}" # File extension pdf xlsx ppt ...
```

## Storage location

FNDL files are stored in `./.fns/index.yaml` relative to the base folder.

## FNDL validation checks

1. Must follow the [YAML Spec](https://yaml.org/spec/).  
1. Must contain at least 3 documents.
1. The top-level item of the first document must be a Block Sequence.   
1. The Block Sequence in the first document can contain Mappings (representing subfolders) or string Scalars (representing files).
1. Mappings in the first document must have exactly one key, which stores the subfolder name.
1. The value of a Mapping in the first document must be either a Block Sequence (when the subfolder has contents) or empty (for empty folders).
1. The second document can contain multiple Mappings, with key values (pattern names) and values. These values store string Scalar arrays (examples of strings that can match the pattern).
1. The third document can contain multiple Mappings, with key values (pattern names) and values. These values store string Scalars (regular expressions that can recognize the pattern).
