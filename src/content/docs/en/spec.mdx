# File Name Description Language - ver0.1_draft

## Definition

FNDL defines the naming conventions assigned to folders and files.
It describes the structure and composition that file and folder names should have.
This specification is stored in YAML format.

## Detailed specifications

Must include 4 parts without omission and in order, using "---".

```yaml

---

### part1: Document description

TITLE: yaml example # Document title. Required field
VERSION: 1.0 # FNDL version. Required field
date: 2020-01-01 # The remaining document fields can be freely added to describe this file. Key names must use lowercase.

---

### part2: Name and path patterns

- folder name: # Ending with ":" indicates it's a folder
  - subfolder name: # Tree structure is expressed with leading spaces
  - <pattern1>-<color> # Patterns are expressed using < and >
---

### part3: Actual examples that can be used for patterns defined in part1. Not required

color:["black","red","white"] # Stored as an array
---

### part4: Describes patterns defined in part1 that can be expressed as regular expressions

pattern1:'.+'
```
Custom pattern names must use lowercase. Uppercase patterns may be included in the specification (YYYY, MM, etc.)

#### Real examples

```yaml

---

TITLE: yaml example
VERSION: 1.0
date: 2020-01-01

---

- Reports:
    - <YYYY>: # Year 2020 2021 2022 ...
        - <MM>: # Month 01 02 03 ...
            - <YYYYMMDD>-<TITLE>.xlsx # 20200101-Marketing Report.xlsx
- <INDEX01>-<routine_work>: # 02-Customer Management 03-Monitoring ...
- projects:
    - <project>: # Project Name
        - <task>:
            - <TITLE>-<task>-<project>-<YYYYMMDD>-v<ver>.<EXT> # Moon Landing Project Proposal-Planning-Moon Landing-20200101-v1.0.ppt

---

# The second area: lists examples of patterns that can be used.

task: ["Research", "Planning", "Development", "Release", "Marketing"]
project: ["MoonLanding", "MoonShot", "MoonWalking"]
EXT: ["pdf", "xlsx", "ppt"]

---

# In the third area: patterns that can be recognized by computers are described using regular expressions.

YYYYMMDD: '(?:19|20)\d{2}(?:0[1-9]|1[0-2])(?:0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])' # Date (Year-Month-Day)
YYYY: '(?:19|20)\d{2}' # Year 2019 2020 2021 ...
MM: "0[1-9]|1[0-2]" # Month 01 02 .. 12
INDEX01: "0[1-9]|[1-9][0-9]" # Number 01 02 03 ...
INDEX001: "0[0-9]{2}|[1-9][0-9]{2}" # Number 001 002 003 ...
ver: '(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-([0-9A-Za-z-]+(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*))?(?:\+([0-9A-Za-z-]+(?:\.[0-9A-Za-z-]+)*))?' # Version 1.0.0 Reference: https://github.com/nils-tekampe/semverdoc/blob/master/semverdoc.md
EXT: "[a-zA-Z0-9]{1,5}" # File extension pdf xlsx ppt ...
```

## Storage location

FNDL files are stored in `./.fns/index.yaml` relative to the base folder.

## FNDL validation

- Must follow the [YAML Spec](https://yaml.org/spec/).
- Must include the following 4 documents:
    1. First document: Document description
        - Must be a mapping with "TITLE" and "VERSION" keys (values must be string scalars)
    2. Second document: File and path patterns
        - Top-level items must be block sequences
        - Block sequences can contain mappings (representing subfolders) or string scalars (representing files)
        - Mappings must have exactly one key, which stores the subfolder name
        - Mapping values must be either block sequences (for subfolders with contents) or empty (for empty folders)
    3. Third document: Pattern examples
        - Can contain multiple mappings with key (pattern name) and value pairs. The value contains an array of string scalars (examples of strings that match the pattern)
    4. Fourth document: Regular expressions for patterns
        - Can contain multiple mappings with key (pattern name) and value pairs. The value contains a string scalar (regular expression that recognizes the pattern)
